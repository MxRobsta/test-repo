# Listening Effort

In addition to the transcription task, you should also rate *listening effort*.
This is a rating of how easy you found the speech to understand.

The range is from 0-100, with the end points being considered as:

0: Very hard: I couldn't understand anything

100: Not at all hard: I found it very easy to understand everything
