# Perceived Intelligibility

In addition to the transcription task, you should also rate *perceived
intelligibility*. This is a rating of how easy you found the speech to
understand.

The range is from 0-100, and some anchor points you should use are:

- **0** I couldn't understand any speech
- **25** I could understand some of the speech
- **50** I understood most of the speech
- **
