# Important Points

Here are some important things to note during the evaluation.

- Some of these samples will be **very difficult**, and you may not be able to
understand any of the words in some of them. This is normal, so please don't
feel like you're "failing"
- On the more challenging samples, please write down **any** words you think
belong to the target speaker (after the red line). It's important that we record
anything you understand correctly.
