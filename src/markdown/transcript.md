# Transcript

For each sample, you will also be provided with the transcript of the
conversation from before the red line. Please read this before beginning each
test sample.

You will always be given the trascript for the target at the top (if they say
anything), followed by the transcript of anyone else who speaks.

Below, you have the same sample as before, but with the transcript included, and
the correct response as before.
