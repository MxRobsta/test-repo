# Training

All of the test samples are grouped by the speaker you're supposed to be
listening to, so for 9 samples in a row, you'll be trying to listen for the
same voice.

Before you evaluate any of these 9 samples, you will be given:

1. A clean sample of the person's speech, approximately 20-30s long
2. Three training samples where that person is the target.

The training samples will be exactly the same as the real samples, but you will
be given the correct transcript.

Below you'll find the rainbow sample for the target speaker, and the same
example that has been seen before.
